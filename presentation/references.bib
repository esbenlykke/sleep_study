	abstract = {Objective: The objective was to conduct a scientiﬁcally rigorous update to the National Sleep Foundation’s sleep duration recommendations.
Methods: The National Sleep Foundation convened an 18-member multidisciplinary expert panel, representing 12 stakeholder organizations, to evaluate scientiﬁc literature concerning sleep duration recommendations. We determined expert recommendations for sufﬁcient sleep durations across the lifespan using the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method.
Results: The panel agreed that, for healthy individuals with normal sleep, the appropriate sleep duration for newborns is between 14 and 17 hours, infants between 12 and 15 hours, toddlers between 11 and 14 hours, preschoolers between 10 and 13 hours, and school-aged children between 9 and 11 hours. For teenagers, 8 to 10 hours was considered appropriate, 7 to 9 hours for young adults and adults, and 7 to 8 hours of sleep for older adults.
Conclusions: Sufﬁcient sleep duration requirements vary across the lifespan and from person to person. The recommendations reported here represent guidelines for healthy individuals and those not suffering from a sleep disorder. Sleep durations outside the recommended range may be appropriate, but deviating far from the},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare conditional random fields (CRF), hidden Markov models (HMMs) and Bayesian linear discriminants (LDs) for cardiorespiratory sleep stage classification on a five-class sleep staging task (wake/N1/N2/N3/REM), to explore the benefits of incorporating time information in the classification and to evaluate the feasibility of sleep staging on obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients.
APPROACH: The classifiers with and without time information were evaluated with 10-fold cross-validation on five-, four- (wake/N1  +  N2/N3/REM) and three-class (wake/NREM/REM) classification tasks using a data set comprising 443 night-time polysomnography (PSG) recordings of 231 participants (180 healthy participants, 100 of which had a 'regular' sleep architecture, and 51 participants previously diagnosed with OSA).
MAIN RESULTS: CRF with time information (CRFt) outperforms all other classifiers on all tasks, achieving a median accuracy and Cohen's κ for all participants of 62.8\% and 0.44 for five classes, 68.8\% and 0.47 for four classes, and 77.6\% and 0.55 for three classes. An advantage was found in training classifiers, specifically for 'regular' and 'OSA' participants, achieving an improvement in classification performance for these groups. For 'regular' participants, CRFt achieved a median accuracy and Cohen's κ of 67.0\% and 0.51, 70.8\% and 0.53 and 81.3\% and 0.62 for five-, four- and three-classes respectively, and for 'OSA' patients, of 59.9\% and 0.40, 69.7\% and 0.45, and 75.8\% and 0.51 for five-, four- and three-classes respectively.
SIGNIFICANCE: The results suggest that CRFt is not only better at learning and predicting more complex and irregular sleep architectures, but that it also performs reasonably well in five-class classification-the standard for sleep scoring used in clinical PSG. Additionally, and albeit with a decrease in performance when compared with healthy participants, sleep stage classification in OSA patients using cardiorespiratory features and CRFt seems feasible with reasonable accuracy.},

Kronauer, Forger, and Jewett have proposed a model for light preprocessing, Process L, representing a biochemical process that converts a light signal into an effective drive on the circadian pacemaker. In the paper presented here, the authors use the classic van der Pol oscillator with Process L and Jewett and Kronauer's model of Aschoff's rule to model the human circadian pacemaker. This simpler cubic model predicts the results of a three-pulse human phase response curve experiment and a two-pulse amplitude reduction study with as much, or more, accuracy as the models of Jewett and Kronauer and Kronauer, Forger, and Jewett, which both employ a nonlinearity of degree 7.

	abstract = {Sleep in mammals is accompanied by a decrease in core body temperature (CBT). The circadian clock in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus regulates daily rhythms in both CBT and arousal states, and these rhythms are normally coupled. Reductions in metabolic heat production resulting from behavioral quiescence and reduced muscle tone along with changes in autonomic nervous system activity and thermoeffector activity contribute to the sleep-related fall in CBT. Reductions in sympathetic tone to the peripheral vasculature resulting in heat loss through the skin are reflected in a sleep-related increase in distal skin temperature that is a prominent feature of sleep onset in humans. Within a sleep episode, patterns of autonomic nervous system and thermoeffector activity and the ability to defend against heat and cold exposure differ during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement sleep. Anatomic and functional integration of the control of arousal states and thermoregulation occur in the preoptic/anterior hypothalamus. Subsets or warm-sensing neurons in the preoptic/anterior hypothalamus implicated in CBT regulation are spontaneously activated during sleep onset and NREM sleep compared to waking and may underlie sleep-related changes in autonomic nervous system and thermoeffector activity.},

	abstract = {Wearable acceleration sensors are increasingly used for the assessment of free-living physical activity. Acceleration sensor calibration is a potential source of error. This study aims to describe and evaluate an autocalibration method to minimize calibration error using segments within the free-living records (no extra experiments needed). The autocalibration method entailed the extraction of nonmovement periods in the data, for which the measured vector magnitude should ideally be the gravitational acceleration (1 g); this property was used to derive calibration correction factors using an iterative closest-point fitting process. The reduction in calibration error was evaluated in data from four cohorts: UK (n = 921), Kuwait (n = 120), Cameroon (n = 311), and Brazil (n = 200). Our method significantly reduced calibration error in all cohorts (P {\textless} 0.01), ranging from 16.6 to 3.0 mg in the Kuwaiti cohort to 76.7 to 8.0 mg error in the Brazil cohort. Utilizing temperature sensor data resulted in a small nonsignificant additional improvement (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Temperature correction coefficients were highest for the z-axis, e.g., 19.6-mg offset per 5°C. Further, application of the autocalibration method had a significant impact on typical metrics used for describing human physical activity, e.g., in Brazil average wrist acceleration was 0.2 to 51\% lower than uncalibrated values depending on metric selection (P {\textless} 0.01). The autocalibration method as presented helps reduce the calibration error in wearable acceleration sensor data and improves comparability of physical activity measures across study locations. Temperature ultization seems essential when temperature deviates substantially from the average temperature in the record but not for multiday summary measures.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.sleep.2020.12.019},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To create a sleep duration classification technique for waist-worn ActiGraph accelerometers in preschool-aged children.
METHODS: Children wore ActiGraph wGT3X-BT accelerometers on their right hip for 7 days (24 h/day). Ground truth nap, sleep, and wake were estimated through visual inspection of accelerometer data, guided by sleep log-sheets and previously published visual inspection heuristics. Raw accelerometer data (30Hz) were used to generate 144 features aggregated to 1-min epochs. Machine learning classification (ie, Random Forest and Hidden Markov Modeling [HMM]) predicted nap, sleep, and wake. A simplified prediction formula was also created using features (n = 10) with the highest mean decrease in Gini index during training of Random Forests, and temporally smoothed with rolling median calculations.
RESULTS: Children (n = 89, mean age = 4.5 years, 67\% boys) contributed {\textgreater}600,000 min of accelerometer data. Overall classification accuracy of the Random Forest and HMM classifier was 96.2\% (95\%CI: 96.1, 96.2\%), with a Kappa score of 0.93. Additionally, overall classification accuracy for the temporally smoothed simplified formula was 93.7\% (95\%CI: 93.6, 93.7\%) with Kappa = 0.87. Nap prediction accuracy was 99.8\% for the final machine learning model, and 86.1\% for the simplified formula. For participant-level daily summaries, generally small but statistically significant differences were found between machine learning and ground truth behaviour predictions, whereas non-significant differences were found between the simplified formulas and ground truth predictions.
CONCLUSIONS: Predictions for both machine learning and the simplified formula had almost perfect agreement with visual inspection ground truth measurements. Future research is needed to confirm these findings using polysomnography ground truth sleep measurements.},

	abstract = {In the last three decades the two-process model of sleep regulation has served as a major conceptual framework in sleep research. It has been applied widely in studies on fatigue and performance and to dissect individual differences in sleep regulation. The model posits that a homeostatic process (Process S) interacts with a process controlled by the circadian pacemaker (Process C), with time-courses derived from physiological and behavioural variables. The model simulates successfully the timing and intensity of sleep in diverse experimental protocols. Electrophysiological recordings from the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) suggest that S and C interact continuously. Oscillators outside the SCN that are linked to energy metabolism are evident in SCN-lesioned arrhythmic animals subjected to restricted feeding or methamphetamine administration, as well as in human subjects during internal desynchronization. In intact animals these peripheral oscillators may dissociate from the central pacemaker rhythm. A sleep/fast and wake/feed phase segregate antagonistic anabolic and catabolic metabolic processes in peripheral tissues. A deficiency of Process S was proposed to account for both depressive sleep disturbances and the antidepressant effect of sleep deprivation. The model supported the development of novel non-pharmacological treatment paradigms in psychiatry, based on manipulating circadian phase, sleep and light exposure. In conclusion, the model remains conceptually useful for promoting the integration of sleep and circadian rhythm research. Sleep appears to have not only a short-term, use-dependent function; it also serves to enforce rest and fasting, thereby supporting the optimization of metabolic processes at the appropriate phase of the 24-h cycle.},

As a result, these devices are limited in their usefulness for clinical and research applications, despite holding much promise. We used a mobile application of our own creation to collect raw acceleration data and heart rate from the Apple Watch worn by participants undergoing polysomnography, as well as during the ambulatory period preceding in lab testing. Using this data, we compared the contributions of multiple features (motion, local standard deviation in heart rate, and "clock proxy") to performance across several classifiers. Best performance was achieved using neural nets, though the differences across classifiers were generally small. For sleep-wake classification, our method scored 90\% of epochs correctly, with 59.6\% of true wake epochs (specificity) and 93\% of true sleep epochs (sensitivity) scored correctly. Accuracy for differentiating wake, NREM sleep, and REM sleep was approximately 72\% when all features were used. We generalized our results by testing the models trained on Apple Watch data using data from the Multi-ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and found that we were able to predict sleep with performance comparable to testing on our own dataset. This study demonstrates, for the first time, the ability to analyze raw acceleration and heart rate data from a ubiquitous wearable device with accepted, disclosed mathematical methods to improve accuracy of sleep and sleep stage prediction.},

Here, we provide a step-by-step analytical framework for evaluating the performance of sleep trackers (including standard actigraphy), as compared with gold-standard polysomnography (PSG) or other reference methods. The analytical guidelines are based on recent recommendations for evaluating and using CST from our group and others (de Zambotti and colleagues; Depner and colleagues), and include raw data organization as well as critical analytical procedures, including discrepancy analysis, Bland-Altman plots, and epoch-by-epoch analysis. Analytical steps are accompanied by open-source R functions (depicted at https://sri-human-sleep.github.io/sleep-trackers-performance/AnalyticalPipeline\_v1.0.0.html). In addition, an empirical sample dataset is used to describe and discuss the main outcomes of the proposed pipeline. The guidelines and the accompanying functions are aimed at standardizing the testing of CSTs performance, to not only increase the replicability of validation studies, but also to provide ready-to-use tools to researchers and clinicians. All in all, this work can help to increase the efficiency, interpretation, and quality of validation studies, and to improve the informed adoption of CST in research and clinical settings.},

We argue that internal validation approaches, such as cross-validation and bootstrap, cannot guarantee the quality of a machine learning model due to potentially biased training data and the complexity of the validation procedure itself. For better evaluating the generalization ability of a learned model, we suggest leveraging on external data sources from elsewhere as validation datasets, namely external validation. Due to the lack of research attractions on external validation, especially a well-structured and comprehensive study, we discuss the necessity for external validation and propose two extensions of the external validation approach that may help reveal the true domain-relevant model from a candidate set. Moreover, we also suggest a procedure to check whether a set of validation datasets is valid and introduce statistical reference points for detecting external data problems.},

	abstract = {Purpose
The frequency of interruptions in sedentary time (sedentary breaks) is an aspect of sedentary behaviors which may be associated with metabolic health outcomes. The aim of this study was to describe the change in the frequency of sedentary breaks over a 10-year period from ages 5 to 15.

Methods
The longitudinal Iowa Bone Development Study has collected accelerometry data at approximately 5, 8, 11, 13, and 15 years of age. Data from participants who wore an accelerometer at least 10 hours per day and three days per data collection episode were used (423 children at age 5, 550 at age 8, 520 at age 11, 454 at age 13, and 344 at age 15). The frequency of sedentary breaks was determined based on accelerometry data and compared by weekday/weekend, time period during the day, gender, and data collection episode.

Results
The frequency of sedentary breaks decreased by {\textgreater} 200 times/day over a 10-year period from ages 5 to 15. Linear regression models estimated a 1.84 times/hour decrease per year for boys and a 2.04 times/hour decrease per year for girls (Ps {\textless} 0.0001). Both boys and girls showed significantly fewer breaks on weekdays from morning to 3:00 PM than on weekends from morning to 3:00 PM (Ps {\textless} 0.0001). The frequency of sedentary breaks was slightly higher among boys than girls (gender difference ≤ 2 times/hour; Ps {\textless} 0.01 at ages 11, 13, and 15).

Conclusion
Breaks in sedentary time notably decrease during childhood and adolescence. During school hours, boys and girls have fewer breaks in sedentary time than during any other time period of weekday or weekend day.},

	abstract = {Five accelerometer-derived methods of identifying nonwear and wear time were compared with a self-report criterion in adults ≥ 56 years of age. Two hundred participants who reported wearing an Actical™ activity monitor for four to seven consecutive days and provided complete daily log sheet data (i.e., the criterion) were included. Four variables were obtained from log sheets: 1) dates the device was worn; 2) time(s) the participant put the device on each day; 3) time(s) the participant removed the device each day; and 4) duration of self-reported nonwear each day. Estimates of wear and nonwear time using 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 minutes of consecutive zeroes were compared to estimates derived from log sheets. Compared with the log sheet, mean daily wear time varied from -84, -43, -24, -14 and -8 min/day for the 60-min, 90-min, 120-min, 150-min and 180-min algorithms, respectively. Daily log sheets indicated 8.5 nonwear bouts per week with 120-min, 150-min and 180-min algorithms estimating 8.2-8.9 nonwear bouts per week. The 60-min and 90-min methods substantially overestimated number of nonwear bouts per week and underestimated time spent in sedentary behavior. Sensitivity (number of compliant days correctly identified as compliant) improved with increasing minutes of consecutive zero counts and stabilized at the 120-min algorithm. The proportion of wear time being sedentary and absolute and proportion of time spent in physical activity of varying intensities were nearly identical for each method. Utilization of at least 120 minutes of consecutive zero counts will provide dependable population-based estimates of wear and nonwear time, and time spent being sedentary and active in older adults wearing the Actical™ activity monitor.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Telemedicine applications could potentially solve many of the challenges faced by the healthcare sectors in Europe. However, a framework for assessment of these technologies is need by decision makers to assist them in choosing the most efficient and cost-effective technologies. Therefore in 2009 the European Commission initiated the development of a framework for assessing telemedicine applications, based on the users' need for information for decision making. This article presents the Model for ASsessment of Telemedicine applications (MAST) developed in this study. METHODS: MAST was developed through workshops with users and stakeholders of telemedicine. RESULTS: Based on the workshops and using the EUnetHTA Core HTA Model as a starting point a three-element model was developed, including: (i) preceding considerations, (ii) multidisciplinary assessment, and (iii) transferability assessment. In the multidisciplinary assessment, the outcomes of telemedicine applications comprise seven domains, based on the domains in the EUnetHTA model. CONCLUSIONS: MAST provides a structure for future assessment of telemedicine applications. MAST will be tested during 2010-13 in twenty studies of telemedicine applications in nine European countries in the EC project Renewing Health.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: An initial stratification of acute whiplash patients into seven risk-strata in relation to 1-year work disability as primary outcome is presented. DESIGN: The design was an observational prospective study of risk factors embedded in a randomised controlled study. SETTING: Acute whiplash patients from units, general practitioners in four Danish counties were referred to two research centres. PARTICIPANTS: During a 2-year inclusion period, acute consecutive whiplash-injured (age 18-70 years, rear-end or frontal-end car accident and WAD (whiplash-associated disorders) grades I-III, symptoms within 72 h, examination prior to 10 days postinjury, capable of written/spoken Danish, without other injuries/fractures, pre-existing significant somatic/psychiatric disorder, drug/alcohol abuse and previous significant pain/headache). 688 (438 women and 250 men) participants were interviewed and examined by a study nurse after 5 days; 605 were completed after 1 year. A risk score which included items of initial neck pain/headache intensity, a number of non-painful complaints and active neck mobility was applied. The primary outcome parameter was 1-year work disability. RESULTS: The risk score and number of sick-listing days were related (Kruskal-Wallis, p\${\textless}\$0.0001). In stratum 1, less than 4\%, but in stratum 7, 68\% were work-disabled after 1 year. Early work assessment (p\${\textless}\$0.0001), impact of the event questionnaire (p\${\textless}\$0.0006), psychophysical pain measures being McGill pain questionnaire parameters (p\${\textless}\$0.0001), pressure pain algometry (p\${\textless}\$0.0001) and palpation (p\${\textless}\$0.0001) showed a significant relationship with risk stratification. ANALYSIS: Findings confirm previous studies reporting intense neck pain/headache and distress as predictors for work disability after whiplash. Neck-mobility was a strong predictor in this study; however, it was a more inconsistent predictor in other studies. CONCLUSIONS: Application of the risk assessment score and use of the risk strata system may be beneficial in future studies and may be considered as a valuable tool to assess return-to-work following injuries; however, further studies are needed.},

Study design Prospective, randomized pilot study. SETTING: Primary contact chiropractic and medical clinics. PATIENTS: Ages 21 to 65 with current episode of neck pain less than 12 weeks in duration. Outcome measures Patient self-report questionnaires and cervical spine motion were assessed at baseline and 3 and 12 weeks post-randomization. INTERVENTIONS: Chiropractic spinal manipulation, prescription medications, and self-care education. RESULTS: Recruitment took place over a 1-month period. Twenty-eight patients were randomized to treatment, and 1 patient (medical care group) refused their treatment assignment and was lost to further follow-up. Twenty-three patients were either "very satisfied" or "completely satisfied" with the care they received in the study. More than half the patients reported 75\% or 100\% improvement (n = 17). No between-group comparisons were planned or performed due to the small sample size. CONCLUSION: Recruitment of patients appears feasible for a full-scale randomized clinical trial evaluating chiropractic spinal manipulation, medical care, and self-care education for acute and subacute neck pain. Patient and provider compliance with study protocols was excellent, and the pilot study allowed us to further develop and optimize our data collection processes.

	abstract = {Long-term monitoring of real-life physical activity (PA) using wearable devices is increasingly used in clinical and epidemiological studies. The quality of the recorded data is an important issue, as unreliable data may negatively affect the outcome measures. A potential source of bias in PA assessment is the non-wearing of a device during the expected monitoring period. Identification of non-wear time is usually performed as a pre-processing step using data recorded by the accelerometer, which is the most common sensor used for PA analysis algorithms. The main issue is the correct differentiation between non-wear time, sleep time, and sedentary wake time, especially in frail older adults or patient groups. Based on the current state of the art, the objectives of this study were to (1) develop robust non-wearing detection algorithms based on data recorded with a wearable device that integrates acceleration and temperature sensors; (2) validate the algorithms using real-world data recorded according to an appropriate measurement protocol. A comparative evaluation of the implemented algorithms indicated better performances (99\%, 97\%, 99\%, and 98\% for sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and negative predictive value, respectively) for an event-based detection algorithm, where the temperature sensor signal was appropriately processed to identify the timing of device removal/non-wear.},

The aim of this study was to describe objectively measured overall physical activity and time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in individuals from the Pelotas (Brazil) birth cohorts, according to weight status, socioeconomic status (SES) and sex.Methods: All children born in 1982, 1993 and 2004 in hospitals in the city of Pelotas, Brazil, constitute the sampling frame; of these 99\% agreed to participate. The most recent follow-ups were conducted between 2010 and 2013. In total, 8974 individuals provided valid data derived from raw triaxial wrist accelerometry. The average acceleration is presented in milli-g (1 mg = 0.001g), and time (min/d) spent in MVPA (\&gt;100 mg) is presented in 5- and 10-min bouts.Results: Mean acceleration in the 1982 (mean age 30.2 years), 1993 (mean age 18.4 years) and 2004 (mean age 6.7 years) cohorts was 35 mg, 39 mg and 60 mg, respectively. Time spent in MVPA was 26 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 25; 27], 43 (95\% CI 42; 44) and 45 (95\% CI 43; 46) min/d in the three cohorts, respectively, using 10-min bouts. Mean MVPA was on average 42\% higher when using 5-min bouts. Males were more active than females and physical activity was inversely associated with age of the cohort and SES. Normal-weight individuals were more active than underweight, overweight and obese participants.Conclusions: Overall physical activity and time spent in MVPA differed by cohort (age), sex, weight status and SES. Higher levels of activity in low SES groups may be explained by incidental physical activity.},

We describe the methods used to collect and analyse accelerometer measured physical activity in over 100,000 participants of the UK Biobank study, and report variation by age, sex, day, time of day, and season. Methods Participants were approached by email to wear a wrist-worn accelerometer for seven days that was posted to them. Physical activity information was extracted from 100Hz raw triaxial acceleration data after calibration, removal of gravity and sensor noise, and identification of wear / non-wear episodes. We report age- and sex-specific wear-time compliance and accelerometer measured physical activity, overall and by hour-of-day, week-weekend day and season. Results 103,712 datasets were received (44.8\% response), with a median wear-time of 6.9 days (IQR:6.5–7.0). 96,600 participants (93.3\%) provided valid data for physical activity analyses. Vector magnitude, a proxy for overall physical activity, was 7.5\% (2.35mg) lower per decade of age (Cohen’s d = 0.9). Women had a higher vector magnitude than men, apart from those aged 45-54yrs. There were major differences in vector magnitude by time of day (d = 0.66). Vector magnitude differences between week and weekend days (d = 0.12 for men, d = 0.09 for women) and between seasons (d = 0.27 for men, d = 0.15 for women) were small. Conclusions It is feasible to collect and analyse objective physical activity data in large studies. The summary measure of overall physical activity is lower in older participants and age-related differences in activity are most prominent in the afternoon and evening. This work lays the foundation for studies of physical activity and its health consequences. Our summary variables are part of the UK Biobank dataset and can be used by researchers as exposures, confounding factors or outcome variables in future analyses.},

The study comprised 2,200 European adolescents (1,184 girls) participating in the HELENA cross-sectional study (2006–2008). Physical activity was measured by accelerometry and was expressed as average intensity (counts/minute) and amount of time (minutes/day) spent engaging in moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA). Time spent in sedentary behaviors was also objectively measured. Cardiorespiratory fitness was measured by means of the 20-m shuttle run test. Level of maternal education was reported by the adolescents. A higher proportion of boys (56.8\% of boys vs. 27.5\% of girls) met the physical activity recommendations of at least 60 minutes/day of MVPA. Adolescents spent most of the registered time in sedentary behaviors (9 hours/day, or 71\% of the registered time). Both average intensity and MVPA were higher in adolescents with high cardiorespiratory fitness, and sedentary time was lower in the high-fitness group. There were no physical activity or sedentary time differences between maternal education categories. These data provide an objective measure of physical activity and amount of time spent in sedentary behaviors in a relatively large number of European adolescents.},

	abstract = {Background
The evidence showing the ill health effects of prolonged sedentary behaviour (SB) is growing. Most studies of SB in older adults have relied on self-report measures of SB. However, SB is difficult for older adults to recall and objective measures that combine accelerometry with inclinometry are now available for more accurately assessing SB. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the validity and reliability of these accelerometers for the assessment of SB in older adults.

Methods
EMBASE, PubMed and EBSCOhost databases were searched for articles published up to December 13, 2017. Articles were eligible if they: a) described reliability, calibration or validation studies of SB measurement in healthy, community-dwelling individuals, b) were published in English, Portuguese or Spanish, and c) were published or in press as journal articles in peer-reviewed journals.

Results
The review identified 15 studies in 17 papers. Of the included studies, 11 assessed the ActiGraph accelerometer. Of these, three examined reliability only, seven (in eight papers) examined validity only and one (in two papers) examined both. The strongest evidence from the studies reviewed is from studies that assessed the validity of the ActiGraph. These studies indicate that analysis of the data using 60-s epochs and a vertical magnitude cut-point {\textless} 200 cpm or using 30- or 60-s epochs with a machine learning algorithm provides the most valid estimates of SB. Non-wear algorithms of 90+ consecutive zeros is also suggested for the ActiGraph.

Conclusions
Few studies have examined the reliability and validity of accelerometers for measuring SB in older adults. Studies to date suggest that the criteria researchers use for classifying an epoch as sedentary instead of as non-wear time (e.g., the non-wear algorithm used) may need to be different for older adults than for younger adults. The required number of hours and days of wear for valid estimates of SB in older adults was not clear from studies to date. More older-adult-specific validation studies of accelerometers are needed, to inform future guidelines on the appropriate criteria to use for analysis of data from different accelerometer brands.

Many authors, editors and peer reviewers of medical papers will not have expert knowledge of statistics or may be unconvinced about the importance of applying correct statistics in medical research. Although there are guidelines on reporting statistics in medical papers, a checklist on the more general and commonly seen aspects of statistics to assess when peer-reviewing an article is needed. In this article, we propose a CHecklist for statistical Assessment of Medical Papers (CHAMP) comprising 30 items related to the design and conduct, data analysis, reporting and presentation, and interpretation of a research paper. While CHAMP is primarily aimed at editors and peer reviewers during the statistical assessment of a medical paper, we believe it will serve as a useful reference to improve authors’ and readers’ practice in their use of statistics in medical research. We strongly encourage editors and peer reviewers to consult CHAMP when assessing manuscripts for potential publication. Authors also may apply CHAMP to ensure the validity of their statistical approach and reporting of medical research, and readers may consider using CHAMP to enhance their statistical assessment of a paper.},

	abstract = {Detection of non-wear periods is an important step in accelerometer data processing. This study evaluated five non-wear detection algorithms for wrist accelerometer data and two rules for non-wear detection when non-wear and sleep algorithms are implemented in parallel. Non-wear algorithms were based on the standard deviation (SD), the high-pass filtered acceleration, or tilt angle. Rules for differentiating sleep from non-wear consisted of an override rule in which any overlap between non-wear and sleep was deemed non-wear; and a 75\% rule in which non-wear periods were deemed sleep if the duration was {\textless} 75\% of the sleep period. Non-wear algorithms were evaluated in 47 children who wore an ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer during school hours for 5 days. Rules for differentiating sleep from non-wear were evaluated in 15 adults who wore a GeneActiv Original accelerometer continuously for 24 hours. Classification accuracy for the non-wear algorithms ranged between 0.86–0.95, with the SD of the vector magnitude providing the best performance. The override rule misclassified 37.1 minutes of sleep as non-wear, while the 75\% rule resulted in no misclassification. Non-wear algorithms based on the SD of the acceleration signal can effectively detect non-wear periods, while application of the 75\% rule can effectively differentiate sleep from non-wear when examined concurrently.},

In this study, we evaluated three epoch-based non-wear algorithms (Hecht, Troiano, and Choi) and one raw-based algorithm (Hees). In addition, we performed a sensitivity analysis to provide insight into the relationship between the algorithms’ hyperparameters and classification performance, as well as to generate tuned hyperparameter values to better detect episodes of wear and non-wear time. We used machine learning to construct a gold-standard dataset by combining two accelerometers and electrocardiogram recordings. The Hecht and Troiano algorithms achieved poor classification performance, while Choi exhibited moderate performance. Meanwhile, Hees outperformed all epoch-based algorithms. The sensitivity analysis and hyperparameter tuning revealed that all algorithms were able to achieve increased classification performance by employing larger intervals and windows, while more stringently defining artificial movement. These classification gains were associated with the ability to lower the false positives (type I error) and do not necessarily indicate a more accurate detection of the total non-wear time. Moreover, our results indicate that with tuned hyperparameters, epoch-based non-wear algorithms are able to perform just as well as raw-based non-wear algorithms with respect to their ability to correctly detect true wear and non-wear episodes.},

	abstract = {Introduction Human body acceleration is often used as an indicator of daily physical activity in epidemiological research. Raw acceleration signals contain three basic components: movement, gravity, and noise. Separation of these becomes increasingly difficult during rotational movements. We aimed to evaluate five different methods (metrics) of processing acceleration signals on their ability to remove the gravitational component of acceleration during standardised mechanical movements and the implications for human daily physical activity assessment. Methods An industrial robot rotated accelerometers in the vertical plane. Radius, frequency, and angular range of motion were systematically varied. Three metrics (Euclidian norm minus one [ENMO], Euclidian norm of the high-pass filtered signals [HFEN], and HFEN plus Euclidean norm of low-pass filtered signals minus 1 g [HFEN+]) were derived for each experimental condition and compared against the reference acceleration (forward kinematics) of the robot arm. We then compared metrics derived from human acceleration signals from the wrist and hip in 97 adults (22–65 yr), and wrist in 63 women (20–35 yr) in whom daily activity-related energy expenditure (PAEE) was available. Results In the robot experiment, HFEN+ had lowest error during (vertical plane) rotations at an oscillating frequency higher than the filter cut-off frequency while for lower frequencies ENMO performed better. In the human experiments, metrics HFEN and ENMO on hip were most discrepant (within- and between-individual explained variance of 0.90 and 0.46, respectively). ENMO, HFEN and HFEN+ explained 34\%, 30\% and 36\% of the variance in daily PAEE, respectively, compared to 26\% for a metric which did not attempt to remove the gravitational component (metric EN). Conclusion In conclusion, none of the metrics as evaluated systematically outperformed all other metrics across a wide range of standardised kinematic conditions. However, choice of metric explains different degrees of variance in daily human physical activity.},

PAEE is commonly estimated with accelerometers attached to the hip or waist, but little is known about the validity and participant acceptability of wrist attachment. The objectives of the current study were to assess the validity of a simple summary measure derived from a wrist-worn accelerometer (GENEA, Unilever Discover, UK) to estimate PAEE in pregnant and non-pregnant women, and to evaluate participant acceptability. Methods Non-pregnant (N = 73) and pregnant (N = 35) Swedish women (aged 20–35 yrs) wore the accelerometer on their wrist for 10 days during which total energy expenditure (TEE) was assessed using doubly-labelled water. PAEE was calculated as 0.9×TEE-REE. British participants (N = 99; aged 22–65 yrs) wore accelerometers on their non-dominant wrist and hip for seven days and were asked to score the acceptability of monitor placement (scored 1 [least] through 10 [most] acceptable). Results There was no significant correlation between body weight and PAEE. In non-pregnant women, acceleration explained 24\% of the variation in PAEE, which decreased to 19\% in leave-one-out cross-validation. In pregnant women, acceleration explained 11\% of the variation in PAEE, which was not significant in leave-one-out cross-validation. Median (IQR) acceptability of wrist and hip placement was 9(8–10) and 9(7–10), respectively; there was a within-individual difference of 0.47 (p{\textless}.001).

        To describe physical activity levels of children (6-11 yr), adolescents (12-19 yr), and adults (20+ yr), using objective data obtained with accelerometers from a representative sample of the U.S. population.
        Methods: 
        These results were obtained from the 2003-2004 National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES), a cross-sectional study of a complex, multistage probability sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population in the United States. Data are described from 6329 participants who provided at least 1 d of accelerometer data and from 4867 participants who provided four or more days of accelerometer data.
        Results: 
        Males are more physically active than females. Physical activity declines dramatically across age groups between childhood and adolescence and continues to decline with age. For example, 42\% of children ages 6-11 yr obtain the recommended 60 min·d−1 of physical activity, whereas only 8\% of adolescents achieve this goal. Among adults, adherence to the recommendation to obtain 30 min·d−1 of physical activity is less than 5\%.
        Conclusions: 
        Objective and subjective measures of physical activity give qualitatively similar results regarding gender and age patterns of activity. However, adherence to physical activity recommendations according to accelerometer-measured activity is substantially lower than according to self-report. Great care must be taken when interpreting self-reported physical activity in clinical practice, public health program design and evaluation, and epidemiological research.},

Twenty-two COPD patients utilizing long-term oxygen recruited from 5 sites of the COPD Clinical Research Network wore a triaxial accelerometer (RT3, Stayhealthy, Monrovia, CA) during waking hours over a 14-day period. Computerized algorithms were composed allowing minute-by-minute activity data to be analyzed to determine, for each minute, whether the monitor was being worn. Temporal alignment allowed determination of average time course of activity level, expressed as average vector magnitude units (VMU, the vectorial sum of activity counts in three orthogonal directions) per minute, for each hour of the day. Mid-day activity was quantified as average VMU/minute between 10AM and 4PM for minutes the monitor was worn. Over the 14 day monitoring period, subjects wore the monitor an average of 11.4 ± 3.0 hours·day− 1. During mid-day hours, subjects wore the monitor 76.3\% of the time and generated an average activity level of 112 ± 55 VMU·min−1. Increase in precision of activity estimates with longer monitoring periods was demonstrated. This analysis scheme allows a detailed temporal pattern of activity to be defined from triaxial accelerometer recordings and has the potential to facilitate comparisons among subjects and between subject groups.

	abstract = {Accurate and low-cost sleep measurement tools are needed in both clinical and epidemiological research. To this end, wearable accelerometers are widely used as they are both low in price and provide reasonably accurate estimates of movement. Techniques to classify sleep from the high-resolution accelerometer data primarily rely on heuristic algorithms. In this paper, we explore the potential of detecting sleep using Random forests. Models were trained using data from three different studies where 134 adult participants (70 with sleep disorder and 64 good healthy sleepers) wore an accelerometer on their wrist during a one-night polysomnography recording in the clinic. The Random forests were able to distinguish sleep-wake states with an F1 score of 73.93\% on a previously unseen test set of 24 participants. Detecting when the accelerometer is not worn was also successful using machine learning (\$\${\textbackslash}hbox \{F1-score\} {\textgreater} 93.31{\textbackslash}\%\$\$), and when combined with our sleep detection models on day-time data provide a sleep estimate that is correlated with self-reported habitual nap behaviour (\$\${\textbackslash}hbox \{r\}=.60\$\$). These Random forest models have been made open-source to aid further research. In line with literature, sleep stage classification turned out to be difficult using only accelerometer data.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: the use of movement monitors (accelerometers) for measuring physical activity (PA) in intervention and population-based studies is becoming a standard methodology for the objective measurement of sedentary and active behaviors and for the validation of subjective PA self-reports. A vital step in PA measurement is the classification of daily time into accelerometer wear and nonwear intervals using its recordings (counts) and an accelerometer-specific algorithm.
PURPOSE: the purpose of this study was to validate and improve a commonly used algorithm for classifying accelerometer wear and nonwear time intervals using objective movement data obtained in the whole-room indirect calorimeter.
METHODS: we conducted a validation study of a wear or nonwear automatic algorithm using data obtained from 49 adults and 76 youth wearing accelerometers during a strictly monitored 24-h stay in a room calorimeter. The accelerometer wear and nonwear time classified by the algorithm was compared with actual wearing time. Potential improvements to the algorithm were examined using the minimum classification error as an optimization target.
RESULTS: the recommended elements in the new algorithm are as follows: 1) zero-count threshold during a nonwear time interval, 2) 90-min time window for consecutive zero or nonzero counts, and 3) allowance of 2-min interval of nonzero counts with the upstream or downstream 30-min consecutive zero-count window for detection of artifactual movements. Compared with the true wearing status, improvements to the algorithm decreased nonwear time misclassification during the waking and the 24-h periods (all P values {\textless} 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: the accelerometer wear or nonwear time algorithm improvements may lead to more accurate estimation of time spent in sedentary and active behaviors.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12889-019-6568-9},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Wrist-worn accelerometers are increasingly used in epidemiological studies to record physical activity. The accelerometer data are usually only analyzed if the convention for compliant wear time is met (i.e. ≥ 10 h per day) but the algorithms to detect wear time have been developed based on data from hip-worn devices only and have not been tested in a free-living setting. The aim of this study was to validate the automatic wear time detection algorithms of one of the most frequently used devices in a free-living setting.
METHODS: Sixty-eight adults wore one ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer on the wrist and one on the hip and additionally recorded wear times for each device separately in a diary. Monitoring phase was during three consecutive days in a free-living setting. Wear time was computed by the algorithms of Troiano and Choi and compared to the diary recordings.
RESULTS: Mean wear time was over 1420 min per day for both devices on all days. Lin's concordance correlation coefficient for the wrist-worn wear time was 0.73 (0.60; 0.82) when comparing the diary with Troiano and 0.78 (0.67; 0.86) when comparing the diary with Choi. For hip-worn devices the respective values were 0.23 (0.13; 0.33) for Troiano and 0.92 (0.88; 0.95) for Choi. Mean and standard deviation values for absolute percentage errors for wrist-worn devices were - 1.3 ± 8.1\% in Troiano and 0.9 ± 7.7\% in Choi. The respective values for hip-worn devices were - 17.5 ± 10\% in Troiano and - 0.8 ± 4.6\% in Choi.
CONCLUSIONS: Hip worn devices may be preferred due to their higher accuracy in physical activity measurement. Automatic wear-time detection can show high errors in individuals, but on a group level, type I, type II, and total errors are generally low when the Choi algorithm is used. In a real-life setting and participants with a high compliance, the algorithm by Choi is sufficient to distinguish wear time from non-wear time on a group level.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although colonoscopy is routinely performed for the management of lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB), the quality of evidence supporting its use is poor and its yield for active bleeding or malignancy is low in practice.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of all adult patients who underwent colonoscopies for LGIB at our hospital system between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2019. A statistical model was built on a cohort of 5195 cases using multiple logistic regressions to predict the detection of various colonoscopy findings and the use of different colonoscopy maneuvers. The model was converted into a risk scoring system, named the TYPICAL Index, and was validated against a separate cohort of 914 cases.
RESULTS: Active bleeding was only seen in 3.8\% of colonoscopies performed for LGIB and endoscopic hemostasis was applied in 43.7\% of actively bleeding lesions. Malignant-appearing lesions were detected in 2.5\% of LGIB procedures and all cases of proximal colonic mass were identified in subjects age above 60. The TYPICAL Index, derived from age, gender, hemoglobin, creatinine, international normalized ratio, and prior colonoscopy for LGIB has a concordance statistic of 0.71 and a negative predictive value of 93.8\% for potential bleeding sources requiring hemostasis, malignant-appearing lesions, or active bleeding on colonoscopy when applied using a threshold of 6.
CONCLUSIONS: Active bleeding and malignancies are rarely encountered and endoscopic hemostasis is seldom required during colonoscopy performed for LGIB. We developed and validated a risk scoring system to identify cases of low predicted diagnostic and therapeutic yield and to guide clinical decision-making.},

We present and evaluate a novel method for the manual annotation of in-bed periods in accelerometer data using the open-source software Audacity®, and we compare the method to the EEG-based sleep monitoring device Zmachine® Insight+ and self-reported sleep diaries. For evaluating the manual annotation method, we calculated the inter- and intra-rater agreement and agreement with Zmachine and sleep diaries using interclass correlation coefficients and Bland–Altman analysis. Our results showed excellent inter- and intra-rater agreement and excellent agreement with Zmachine and sleep diaries. The Bland–Altman limits of agreement were generally around ±30 min for the comparison between the manual annotation and the Zmachine timestamps for the in-bed period. Moreover, the mean bias was minuscule. We conclude that the manual annotation method presented is a viable option for annotating in-bed periods in accelerometer data, which will further qualify datasets without labeling or sleep records.},

	abstract = {Large epidemiological studies that use accelerometers for physical behavior and sleep assessment differ in the location of the accelerometer attachment and the signal aggregation metric chosen. This study aimed to assess the comparability of acceleration metrics between commonly-used body-attachment locations for 24 hours, waking and sleeping hours, and to test comparability of PA cut points between dominant and non-dominant wrist. Forty-five young adults (23 women, 18–41 years) were included and GT3X + accelerometers (ActiGraph, Pensacola, FL, USA) were placed on their right hip, dominant, and non-dominant wrist for 7 days. We derived Euclidean Norm Minus One g (ENMO), Low-pass filtered ENMO (LFENMO), Mean Amplitude Deviation (MAD) and ActiGraph activity counts over 5-second epochs from the raw accelerations. Metric values were compared using a correlation analysis, and by plotting the differences by time of the day. Cut points for the dominant wrist were derived using Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient optimization in a grid of possible thresholds, using the non-dominant wrist estimates as reference. They were cross-validated in a separate sample (N = 36, 10 women, 22–30 years). Shared variances between pairs of acceleration metrics varied across sites and metric pairs (range in r2: 0.19–0.97, all p {\textless} 0.01), suggesting that some sites and metrics are associated, and others are not. We observed higher metric values in dominant vs. non-dominant wrist, thus, we developed cut points for dominant wrist based on ENMO to classify sedentary time ({\textless}50 mg), light PA (50–110 mg), moderate PA (110–440 mg) and vigorous PA (≥440 mg). Our findings suggest differences between dominant and non-dominant wrist, and we proposed new cut points to attenuate these differences. ENMO and LFENMO were the most similar metrics, and they showed good comparability with MAD. However, counts were not comparable with ENMO, LFENMO and MAD.},

	abstract = {Background The current guidelines for aerobic activity require that adults carry out ≥150 min/week of moderate-intensity physical activity, with a large body of epidemiological evidence showing this level of activity to decrease the incidence of many chronic diseases. Less is known about whether light-intensity activities also have such benefits, and whether sedentary behaviour is an independent predictor of increased risks of these chronic diseases, as imprecise assessments of these behaviours and cross-sectional study designs have limited knowledge to date.
Methods Recent technological advances in assessment methods have made the use of movement sensors, such as the accelerometer, feasible for use in longitudinal, large-scale epidemiological studies. Several such studies are collecting sensor-assessed, objective measures of physical activity with the aim of relating these to the development of clinical endpoints. This is a relatively new area of research; thus, in this article, we use the Women's Health Study (WHS) as a case study to illustrate the challenges related to data collection, data processing and analyses of the vast amount of data collected.
Results The WHS plans to collect 7 days of accelerometer-assessed physical activity and sedentary behaviour in ∼18 000 women aged ≥62 years. Several logistical challenges exist in collecting data; nonetheless, as of 31 August 2013, 11 590 women have already provided some data. In addition, the WHS experience on data reduction and data analyses can help inform other similar large-scale epidemiological studies.
Conclusions Important data on the health effects of light-intensity activity and sedentary behaviour will emerge from large-scale epidemiological studies collecting objective assessments of these behaviours.},

	abstract = {The links between increased participation in Physical Activity (PA) and improvements in health are well established. As this body of evidence has grown, so too has the search for measures of PA with high levels of methodological effectiveness (i.e. validity, reliability and responsiveness to change). The aim of this "review of reviews" was to provide a comprehensive overview of the methodological effectiveness of currently employed measures of PA, to aid researchers in their selection of an appropriate tool. A total of 63 review articles were included in this review, and the original articles cited by these reviews were included in order to extract detailed information on methodological effectiveness.Self-report measures of PA have been most frequently examined for methodological effectiveness, with highly variable findings identified across a broad range of behaviours. The evidence-base for the methodological effectiveness of objective monitors, particularly accelerometers/activity monitors, is increasing, with lower levels of variability observed for validity and reliability when compared to subjective measures. Unfortunately, responsiveness to change across all measures and behaviours remains under-researched, with limited information available.Other criteria beyond methodological effectiveness often influence tool selection, including cost and feasibility. However, researchers must be aware of the methodological effectiveness of any measure selected for use when examining PA. Although no "perfect" tool for the examination of PA in adults exists, it is suggested that researchers aim to incorporate appropriate objective measures, specific to the behaviours of interests, when examining PA in free-living environments.},

	abstract = {To enable inter- and intrastudy comparisons it is important to ascertain comparability among accelerometer models.
        Purpose 
        The purpose of this study was to compare raw and count data between hip-worn ActiGraph GT3X+ and GT9X Link accelerometers.
        Methods 
        Adults (n = 26 (n = 15 women); age, 49.1 ± 20.0 yr) wore GT3X+ and Link accelerometers over the right hip for an 80-min protocol involving 12–21 sedentary, household, and ambulatory/exercise activities lasting 2–15 min each. For each accelerometer, mean and variance of the raw (60 Hz) data for each axis and vector magnitude (VM) were extracted in 30-s epochs. A machine learning model (Montoye 2015) was used to predict energy expenditure in METs from the raw data. Raw data were also processed into activity counts in 30-s epochs for each axis and VM, with Freedson 1998 and 2011 count-based regression models used to predict METs. Time spent in sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous intensities was derived from predicted METs from each model. Correlations were calculated to compare raw and count data between accelerometers, and percent agreement was used to compare epoch-by-epoch activity intensity.
        Results 
        For raw data, correlations for mean acceleration were 0.96 ± 0.05, 0.89 ± 0.16, 0.71 ± 0.33, and 0.80 ± 0.28, and those for variance were 0.98 ± 0.02, 0.98 ± 0.03, 0.91 ± 0.06, and 1.00 ± 0.00 in the X, Y, and Z axes and VM, respectively. For count data, corresponding correlations were 1.00 ± 0.01, 0.98 ± 0.02, 0.96 ± 0.04, and 1.00 ± 0.00, respectively. Freedson 1998 and 2011 count-based models had significantly higher percent agreement for activity intensity (95.1\% ± 5.6\% and 95.5\% ± 4.0\%) compared with the Montoye 2015 raw data model (61.5\% ± 27.6\%; P {\textless} 0.001).
        Conclusions 
        Count data were more highly comparable than raw data between accelerometers. Data filtering and/or more robust raw data models are needed to improve raw data comparability between ActiGraph GT3X+ and Link accelerometers.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accelerometers are widely used to measure sedentary time and daily physical activity (PA). However, data collection and processing criteria, such as non-wear time rules might affect the assessment of total PA and sedentary time and the associations with health variables. The study aimed to investigate whether the choice of different non-wear time definitions would affect the outcomes of PA levels in youth.
METHODS: Seventy-seven healthy youngsters (44 boys), aged 10-17 years, wore an accelerometer and kept a non-wear log diary during 4 consecutives days. We compared 7 published algorithms (10, 15, 20, 30, 60 min of continuous zeros, Choi, and Troiano algorithms). Agreements of each algorithm with the log diary method were assessed using Bland-Altmans plots and by calculating the concordance correlation coefficient for repeated measures.
RESULTS: Variations in time spent in sedentary and moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) were 30 and 3.7\%. Compared with the log diary method, greater discrepancies were found for the algorithm 10 min (p {\textless} 0.001). For the time assessed in sedentary, the agreement with diary was excellent for the 4 algorithms (Choi, r = 0.79; Troiano, r = 0.81; 30 min, r = 0.79; 60 min, r = 0.81). Concordance for each method was excellent for the assessment of time spent in MVPA ({\textgreater} 0.86). The agreement for the wear time assessment was excellent for 5 algorithms (Choi r = 0.79; Troiano r = 0.79; 20 min r = 0.77; 30 min r = 0.80; 60 min r = 0.80).
CONCLUSIONS: The choice of non-wear time rules may considerably affect the sedentary time assessment in youth. Using of appropriate data reduction decision in youth is needed to limit differences in associations between health outcomes and sedentary behaviors and may improve comparability for future studies. Based on our results, we recommend the use of the algorithm of 30 min of continuous zeros for defining non-wear time to improve the accuracy in assessing PA levels in youth.

	abstract = {Objective To classify wear and non-wear time of accelerometer data for accurately quantifying physical activity in public health or population level research.
Design A bi-moving-window-based approach was used to combine acceleration and skin temperature data to identify wear and non-wear time events in triaxial accelerometer data that monitor physical activity.
Setting Local residents in Swansea, Wales, UK.
Participants 50 participants aged under 16 years (n=23) and over 17 years (n=27) were recruited in two phases: phase 1: design of the wear/non-wear algorithm (n=20) and phase 2: validation of the algorithm (n=30).
Methods Participants wore a triaxial accelerometer (GeneActiv) against the skin surface on the wrist (adults) or ankle (children). Participants kept a diary to record the timings of wear and non-wear and were asked to ensure that events of wear/non-wear last for a minimum of 15 min.
Results The overall sensitivity of the proposed method was 0.94 (95\% CI 0.90 to 0.98) and specificity 0.91 (95\% CI 0.88 to 0.94). It performed equally well for children compared with adults, and females compared with males. Using surface skin temperature data in combination with acceleration data significantly improved the classification of wear/non-wear time when compared with methods that used acceleration data only (p{\textless}0.01).
Conclusions Using either accelerometer seismic information or temperature information alone is prone to considerable error. Combining both sources of data can give accurate estimates of non-wear periods thus giving better classification of sedentary behaviour. This method can be used in population studies of physical activity in free-living environments.},

This study explores compliance with a novel dual-accelerometer system for capturing 24 h movement patterns in two free-living samples of children and adults. A total of 103 children aged 8 years and 83 adults aged 20-60 years were recruited. Using a combination of medical dressing and purpose-built foam pouches, participants were fitted with two Axivity AX3 accelerometers\&mdash;one to the thigh and the other to the lower back\&mdash;for seven 24 h periods. AX3 accelerometers contain an inbuilt skin temperature sensor that facilitates wear time estimation. The median (IQR) wear time in children was 160 (67) h and 165 (79) h (out of a maximum of 168 h) for back and thigh placement, respectively. Wear time was significantly higher and less variable in adults, with a median (IQR) for back and thigh placement of 168 (1) and 168 (0) h. A greater proportion of adults (71.6\%) achieved the maximum number of complete days when compared to children (41.7\%). We conclude that a dual-accelerometer protocol using skin attachment methods holds considerable promise for monitoring 24-h movement behaviours in both children and adults.},

	abstract = {To date, non-wear detection algorithms commonly employ a 30, 60, or even 90 mins interval or window in which acceleration values need to be below a threshold value. A major drawback of such intervals is that they need to be long enough to prevent false positives (type I errors), while short enough to prevent false negatives (type II errors), which limits detecting both short and longer episodes of non-wear time. In this paper, we propose a novel non-wear detection algorithm that eliminates the need for an interval. Rather than inspecting acceleration within intervals, we explore acceleration right before and right after an episode of non-wear time. We trained a deep convolutional neural network that was able to infer non-wear time by detecting when the accelerometer was removed and when it was placed back on again. We evaluate our algorithm against several baseline and existing non-wear algorithms, and our algorithm achieves a perfect precision, a recall of 0.9962, and an F1 score of 0.9981, outperforming all evaluated algorithms. Although our algorithm was developed using patterns learned from a hip-worn accelerometer, we propose algorithmic steps that can easily be applied to a wrist-worn accelerometer and a retrained classification model.},

Therefore, longitudinal studies and big-data approaches assessing sleep dynamics are lacking. Here, we present the first large-scale analysis of human sleep dynamics in real life by making use of longitudinal wrist movement recordings of {\textgreater}16,000 sleep bouts from 573 subjects. Through non-linear conversion of locomotor activity to "Locomotor Inactivity During Sleep" (LIDS), movement patterns are exposed that directly reflect ultradian sleep cycles and replicate the dynamics of laboratory sleep parameters. Our current analyses indicate no sex differences in LIDS-derived sleep dynamics, whereas especially age but also shift work have pronounced effects, specifically on decline rates and ultradian amplitude. In contrast, ultradian period and phase emerged as remarkably stable across the tested variables. Our approach and results provide the necessary quantitative sleep phenotypes for large field studies and outcome assessments in clinical trials.},

A method was developed (Acti4) to discriminate between these physical activity types based on threshold values of standard deviation of acceleration and the derived inclination. Moreover, the ability of the accelerometer placed at the thigh to detect sitting posture was separately validated during free living by comparison with recordings of pressure sensors in the hip pockets. Results: Sensitivity for discriminating between the physical activity types sitting, standing, walking, running, and cycling in the standardized trials were 99\%–100\% and 95\% for walking stairs. Specificity was higher than 99\% for all activities. During free living (140 hours of measurements), sensitivity and specificity for detection of sitting posture were 98\% and 93\%, respectively.

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES:

To determine the reasons for inter-scorer variability in sleep staging of polysomnograms (PSGs).

METHODS:

Fifty-six PSGs were scored (5-stage sleep scoring) by 2 experienced technologists, (first manual, M1). Months later, the technologists edited their own scoring (second manual, M2) based upon feedback from the investigators that highlighted differences between their scoring. The PSGs were then scored with an automatic system (Auto) and the technologists edited them, epoch-by-epoch (Edited-Auto). This resulted in 6 different manual scores for each PSG. Epochs were classified as scorer errors (one M1 score differed from the other 5 scores), scorer bias (all 3 scores of each technologist were similar, but differed from the other technologist) and equivocal (sleep scoring was inconsistent within and between technologists).

RESULTS:

Percent agreement after M1 was 78.9\% ± 9.0\% and was unchanged after M2 (78.1\% ± 9.7\%) despite numerous edits (≈40/PSG) by the scorers. Agreement in Edited-Auto was higher (86.5\% ± 6.4\%, p {\textless} 1E−9). Scorer errors ({\textless} 2\% of epochs) and scorer bias (3.5\% ± 2.3\% of epochs) together accounted for {\textless} 20\% of M1 disagreements. A large number of epochs (92 ± 44/PSG) with scoring agreement in M1 were subsequently changed in M2 and/or Edited-Auto. Equivocal epochs, which showed scoring inconsistency, accounted for 28\% ± 12\% of all epochs, and up to 76\% of all epochs in individual patients. Disagreements were largely between awake/NREM, N1/N2, and N2/N3 sleep.

CONCLUSION:

Inter-scorer variability is largely due to epochs that are difficult to classify. Availability of digitally identified events (e.g., spindles) or calculated variables (e.g., depth of sleep, delta wave duration) during scoring may greatly reduce scoring variability.

	abstract = {Study Objectives To develop and validate a novel non-contact system for whole-night sleep evaluation using breathing sounds analysis (BSA). Design Whole-night breathing sounds (using ambient microphone) and polysomnography (PSG) were simultaneously collected at a sleep laboratory (mean recording time 7.1 hours). A set of acoustic features quantifying breathing pattern were developed to distinguish between sleep and wake epochs (30 sec segments). Epochs (n = 59,108 design study and n = 68,560 validation study) were classified using AdaBoost classifier and validated epoch-by-epoch for sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, accuracy, and Cohen's kappa. Sleep quality parameters were calculated based on the sleep/wake classifications and compared with PSG for validity. Setting University affiliated sleep-wake disorder center and biomedical signal processing laboratory. Patients One hundred and fifty patients (age 54.0±14.8 years, BMI 31.6±5.5 kg/m2, m/f 97/53) referred for PSG were prospectively and consecutively recruited. The system was trained (design study) on 80 subjects; validation study was blindly performed on the additional 70 subjects. Measurements and Results Epoch-by-epoch accuracy rate for the validation study was 83.3\% with sensitivity of 92.2\% (sleep as sleep), specificity of 56.6\% (awake as awake), and Cohen's kappa of 0.508. Comparing sleep quality parameters of BSA and PSG demonstrate average error of sleep latency, total sleep time, wake after sleep onset, and sleep efficiency of 16.6 min, 35.8 min, and 29.6 min, and 8\%, respectively. Conclusions This study provides evidence that sleep-wake activity and sleep quality parameters can be reliably estimated solely using breathing sound analysis. This study highlights the potential of this innovative approach to measure sleep in research and clinical circumstances.},

	abstract = {Purpose
The current gold standard to detect sleep/wakefulness is based on electroencephalogram, which is inconvenient if included in portable sleep screening devices. Therefore, a challenge in the portable devices is sleeping time estimation. Without sleeping time, sleep parameters such as apnea/hypopnea index (AHI), an index for quantifying sleep apnea severity, can be underestimated. Recent studies have used tracheal sounds and movements for sleep screening and calculating AHI without considering sleeping time. In this study, we investigated the detection of sleep/wakefulness states and estimation of sleep parameters using tracheal sounds and movements.

Materials and Methods
Participants with suspected sleep apnea who were referred for sleep screening were included in this study. Simultaneously with polysomnography, tracheal sounds and movements were recorded with a small wearable device, called the Patch, attached over the trachea. Each 30-second epoch of tracheal data was scored as sleep or wakefulness using an automatic classification algorithm. The performance of the algorithm was compared to the sleep/wakefulness scored blindly based on the polysomnography.

Results
Eighty-eight subjects were included in this study. The accuracy of sleep/wakefulness detection was 82.3±8.66\% with a sensitivity of 87.8±10.8 \% (sleep), specificity of 71.4±18.5\% (awake), F1 of 88.1±9.3\% and Cohen’s kappa of 0.54. The correlations between the estimated and polysomnography-based measures for total sleep time and sleep efficiency were 0.78 (p{\textless}0.001) and 0.70 (p{\textless}0.001), respectively.

Conclusion
Sleep/wakefulness periods can be detected using tracheal sound and movements. The results of this study combined with our previous studies on screening sleep apnea with tracheal sounds provide strong evidence that respiratory sounds analysis can be used to develop robust, convenient and cost-effective portable devices for sleep apnea monitoring.},

	abstract = {Accelerometry is a low-cost and noninvasive method that has been used to discriminate sleep from wake, however, its utility to detect sleep stages is unclear. We detail the development and comparison of methods which utilise raw, triaxial accelerometry data to classify varying stages of sleep, ranging from sleep/wake detection to discriminating rapid eye movement sleep, stage one sleep, stage two sleep, deep sleep and wake. First- and second-order hidden Markov models (HMMs) with time-homogeneous and time-varying transition probability matrices, along with continuous acceleration observations in the form of a Gaussian-observation HMM and K-means classified acceleration in a discrete-observation HMM were explored. In addition, generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs) with binary and multinomial responses and logit link functions were considered as was whether incorporating adjoining acceleration information into the models improved prediction. Model predictions were compared to the reference-standard in sleep detection (polysomnography) and outcome accuracies were calculated. Consistently, HMMs yielded greater sleep stage detection than GLMMs but there was little difference between first- and second-order HMMs. Varying degrees of difference were observed when comparing Gaussian-observation HMMs to discrete-observation HMMs, and time-varying HMMs yielded greater discrimination than time-homogeneous HMMs, as did models which considered adjoining acceleration information. These results suggest that wrist-worn accelerometry data may be able to detect sleep stages but that further investigation is required to optimise classification accuracy.},

	abstract = {Actigraphy is a method used to study sleep-wake patterns and circadian rhythms by assessing movement, most commonly of the wrist. These evidence-based practice parameters are an update to the Practice Parameters for the Use of Actigraphy in the Clinical Assessment of Sleep Disorders, published in 1995. These practice parameters were developed by the Standards of Practice Committee and reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Recommendations are based on the accompanying comprehensive review of the medical literature regarding the role of actigraphy, which was developed by a task force commissioned by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. The following recommendations serve as a guide to the appropriate use of actigraphy. Actigraphy is reliable and valid for detecting sleep in normal, healthy populations, but less reliable for detecting disturbed sleep. Although actigraphy is not indicated for the routine diagnosis, assessment, or management of any of the sleep disorders, it may serve as a useful adjunct to routine clinical evaluation of insomnia, circadian-rhythm disorders, and excessive sleepiness, and may be helpful in the assessment of specific aspects of some disorders, such as insomnia and restless legs syndrome/periodic limb movement disorder. The assessment of daytime sleepiness, the demonstration of multiday human-rest activity patterns, and the estimation of sleep-wake patterns are potential uses of actigraphy in clinical situations where other techniques cannot provide similar information (e.g., psychiatric ward patients). Superiority of actigraphy placement on different parts of the body is not currently established. Actigraphy may be useful in characterizing and monitoring circadian rhythm patterns or disturbances in certain special populations (e.g., children, demented individuals), and appears useful as an outcome measure in certain applications and populations. Although actigraphy may be a useful adjunct to portable sleep apnea testing, the use of actigraphy alone in the detection of sleep apnea is not currently established. Specific technical recommendations are discussed, such as using concomitant completion of a sleep log for artifact rejection and timing of lights out and on; conducting actigraphy studies for a minimum of three consecutive 24-hour periods; requiring raw data inspection; permitting some preprocessing of movement counts; stating that epoch lengths up to 1 minute are usually sufficient, except for circadian rhythm assessment; requiring interpretation to be performed manually by visual inspection; and allowing automatic scoring in addition to manual scoring methods.},

The present study aims to investigate the ability of the two most commonly employed methods, actigraphy and sleep logs, to identify circadian sleep/wake disorders and measure changes in sleep patterns over time. In addition, the study assesses whether sleep measured by both methods shows the same relationship with an established circadian phase marker, urinary 6-sulphatoxymelatonin. A total of 49 registered blind subjects with different types of circadian rhythms were studied daily for at least four weeks. Grouped analysis of all study days for all subjects was performed for all sleep parameters (1062-1150 days data per sleep parameter). Good correlations were observed when comparing the measurement of sleep timing and duration (sleep onset, sleep offset, night sleep duration, day-time nap duration). However, the methods were poorly correlated in their assessment of transitions between sleep and wake states (sleep latency, number and duration of night awakenings, number of day-time naps). There were also large and inconsistent differences in the measurement of the absolute sleep parameters. Overall, actigraphs recorded a shorter sleep latency, advanced onset time, increased number and duration of night awakenings, delayed offset, increased night sleep duration and increased number and duration of naps compared with the subjective sleep logs. Despite this, there was good agreement between the methods for measuring changes in sleep patterns over time. In particular, the methods agreed when assessing changes in sleep in relation to a circadian phase marker (the 6-sulphatoxymelatonin (aMT6s) rhythm) in both entrained (n = 30) and free-running (n = 4) subjects.},

Several validated questionnaires have been developed to assess sleep, but these tools are lengthy to administer and may be impractical for epidemiologic studies. We examined whether a 3-item sleep questionnaire, similar to those typically used in epidemiologic studies, closely corresponded with objective measures of sleep as assessed using actigraphy monitoring.
METHODS: Eligible participants were Western Australian women aged 18 to 80 years. Participants completed a sleep questionnaire, wore a wrist actigraph for 7 nights, and completed a brief daily sleep log. Objective actigraphy measurements for 56 participants were summarized by mean and mode and compared with the subjective reports, using weighted kappa and delta.
RESULTS: Data collected from the questionnaire showed poor agreement with objectively measured sleep, with kappas ranging from -0.19 to 0.14.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that sleep questions typically used in epidemiologic studies do not closely correspond with objective measures of sleep as assessed using actigraphy. The findings have implications for studies that have used such sleep questions. A means of appropriately measuring sleep as a risk factor in epidemiologic studies remains to be determined.},

	abstract = {In summary, although actigraphy is not as accurate as PSG for determining some sleep measurements, studies are in general agreement that actigraphy, with its ability to record continuously for long time periods, is more reliable than sleep logs which rely on the patients' recall of how many times they woke up or how long they slept during the night and is more reliable than observations which only capture short time periods. Actigraphy can provide information obtainable in no other practical way. It can also have a role in the medical care of patients with sleep disorders. However, it should not be held to the same expectations as polysomnography. Actigraphy is one-dimensional, whereas polysomnography comprises at least 3 distinct types of data (EEG, EOG, EMG), which jointly determine whether a person is asleep or awake. It is therefore doubtful whether actigraphic data will ever be informationally equivalent to the PSG, although progress on hardware and data processing software is continuously being made. Although the 1995 practice parameters paper determined that actigraphy was not appropriate for the diagnosis of sleep disorders, more recent studies suggest that for some disorders, actigraphy may be more practical than PSG. While actigraphy is still not appropriate for the diagnosis of sleep disordered breathing or of periodic limb movements in sleep, it is highly appropriate for examining the sleep variability (i.e., night-to-night variability) in patients with insomnia. Actigraphy is also appropriate for the assessment of and stability of treatment effects of anything from hypnotic drugs to light treatment to CPAP, particularly if assessments are done before and after the start of treatment. A recent independent review of the actigraphy literature by Sadeh and Acebo reached many of these same conclusions. Some of the research studies failed to find relationships between sleep measures and health-related symptoms. The interpretation of these data is also not clear-cut. Is it that the actigraph is not reliable enough to the access the relationship between sleep changes and quality of life measures, or, is it that, in fact, there is no relationship between sleep in that population and quality of life measures? Other studies of sleep disordered breathing, where actigraphy was not used and was not an outcome measure also failed to find any relationship with quality of life. Is it then the actigraph that is not reliable or that the associations just do not exist? The one area where actigraphy can be used for clinical diagnosis is in the evaluation of circadian rhythm disorders. Actigraphy has been shown to be very good for identifying rhythms. Results of actigraphic recordings correlate well with measurements of melatonin and of core body temperature rhythms. Activity records also show sleep disturbance when sleep is attempted at an unfavorable phase of the circadian cycle. Actigraphy therefore would be particularly good for aiding in the diagnosis of delayed or advanced sleep phase syndrome, non-24-hour-sleep syndrome and in the evaluation of sleep disturbances in shift workers. It must be remembered, however, that overt rest-activity rhythms are susceptible to various masking effects, so they may not always show the underlying rhythm of the endogenous circadian pacemaker. In conclusion, the latest set of research articles suggest that in the clinical setting, actigraphy is reliable for evaluating sleep patterns in patients with insomnia, for studying the effect of treatments designed to improve sleep, in the diagnosis of circadian rhythm disorders (including shift work), and in evaluating sleep in individuals who are less likely to tolerate PSG, such as infants and demented elderly. While actigraphy has been used in research studies for many years, up to now, methodological issues had not been systematically addressed in clinical research and practice. Those issues have now been addressed and actigraphy may now be reaching the maturity needed for application in the clinical arena.},

METHODS: A systematic review was performed in 3 databases (Medline, Embase, and Psycinfo), including all literature until July 2012.
RESULTS: Thirty-two studies were included in the review. Actigraphy could demonstrate that total sleep time and sleep efficiency was reduced after surgery and number of awakenings was increased in patients undergoing major surgery. Disturbances were less severe in patients undergoing minor surgery. Actigraphy could be used to differentiate between delirious and non-delirious patients after major surgery. Actigraphy measurements could determine a differential effect of surgery based on the patient's age. The effect of pharmacological interventions (chronobiotics and hypnotics) in surgical patients could also be demonstrated by actigraphy.

Associations of measurement error for TST (PSG-actigraphy) with demographics, medical history, exam data, and sleep characteristics were examined.
METHODS: Participants underwent in-home 12-channel PSG. Actigraphy data were collected in 3 modes: proportional integration mode (PIM), time above threshold (TAT) and zero crossings mode (ZCM). The analysis cohort was a subgroup of 889 men (mean age 76.4 years) from the MrOS Sleep Study with concurrently measured PSG and actigraphy. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to compare the association between PSG and actigraphy.
RESULTS: The PIM mode of actigraphy corresponded moderately to PSG for all measures (ICCs 0.32 to 0.57), TAT a little lower (ICCs 0.17 to 0.47), and ZCM lower still (ICCs 0.16 to 0.33). The PIM mode corresponded best to PSG (ICCs TST 0.57; SE 0.46; SOL 0.23; WASO 0.54), though the estimations from PSG and PIM mode differed significantly (p {\textless} 0.01). The PIM mode overestimated TST by 13.2 min on average, but underestimated TST for those in certain subgroups: those with excessive daytime sleepiness, less sleep fragmentation, or more sleep disordered breathing (p {\textless} 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Sleep parameters from the PIM and TAT modes of actigraphy corresponded reasonably well to PSG in this population, with the PIM mode correlating highest. Systematic measurement error was observed within subgroups with different sleep characteristics.},

	abstract = {Background Differentiating nonwear time from sleep and wake times is essential for the estimation of sleep duration based on actigraphy data. To efficiently analyze large-scale data sets, an automatic method of identifying these three different states is required. Therefore, we developed a classification algorithm to determine nonwear, sleep and wake periods from accelerometer data. Our work aimed to (I) develop a new pattern recognition algorithm for identifying nonwear periods from actigraphy data based on the influence of respiration rate on the power spectrum of the acceleration signal and implement it in an automatic classification algorithm for nonwear/sleep/wake states; (II) address motion artifacts that occur during nonwear periods and are known to cause misclassification of these periods; (III) adjust the algorithm depending on the sensor position (wrist, chest); and (IV) validate the algorithm on both healthy individuals and patients with sleep disorders. Methods The study involved 98 participants who wore wrist and chest acceleration sensors for one day of measurements. They spent one night in the sleep laboratory and continued to wear the sensors outside of the laboratory for the remainder of the day. The results of the classification algorithm were compared to those of the reference source: polysomnography for wake/sleep and manual annotations for nonwear/wear classification. Results The median kappa values for the two locations were 0.83 (wrist) and 0.84 (chest). The level of agreement did not vary significantly by sleep health (good sleepers vs. subjects with sleep disorders) (p = 0.348, p = 0.118) or by sex (p = 0.442, p = 0.456). The intraclass correlation coefficients of nonwear total time between the reference and the algorithm were 0.92 and 0.97 with the outliers and 0.95 and 0.98 after the outliers were removed for the wrist and chest, respectively. There was no evidence of an association between the mean difference (and 95\% limits of agreement) and the mean of the two methods for either sensor position (wrist p = 0.110, chest p = 0.164), and the mean differences (algorithm minus reference) were 5.11 [95\% LoA −15.4–25.7] and 1.32 [95\% LoA −9.59–12.24] min/day, respectively, after the outliers were removed. Discussion We studied the influence of the respiration wave on the power spectrum of the acceleration signal for the differentiation of nonwear periods from sleep and wake periods. The algorithm combined both spectral analysis of the acceleration signal and rescoring. Based on the Bland-Altman analysis, the chest-worn accelerometer showed better results than the wrist-worn accelerometer.},

	abstract = {Wrist-worn accelerometers are increasingly being used for the assessment of physical activity in population studies, but little is known about their value for sleep assessment. We developed a novel method of assessing sleep duration using data from 4,094 Whitehall II Study (United Kingdom, 2012–2013) participants aged 60–83 who wore the accelerometer for 9 consecutive days, filled in a sleep log and reported sleep duration via questionnaire. Our sleep detection algorithm defined (nocturnal) sleep as a period of sustained inactivity, itself detected as the absence of change in arm angle greater than 5 degrees for 5 minutes or more, during a period recorded as sleep by the participant in their sleep log. The resulting estimate of sleep duration had a moderate (but similar to previous findings) agreement with questionnaire based measures for time in bed, defined as the difference between sleep onset and waking time (kappa = 0.32, 95\%CI:0.29,0.34) and total sleep duration (kappa = 0.39, 0.36,0.42). This estimate was lower for time in bed for women, depressed participants, those reporting more insomnia symptoms, and on weekend days. No such group differences were found for total sleep duration. Our algorithm was validated against data from a polysomnography study on 28 persons which found a longer time window and lower angle threshold to have better sensitivity to wakefulness, while the reverse was true for sensitivity to sleep. The novelty of our method is the use of a generic algorithm that will allow comparison between studies rather than a “count” based, device specific method.},

Detected sleep period time window (SPT-window) was compared against sleep diary in 3752 participants (range = 60–82 years) and polysomnography in sleep clinic patients (N = 28) and in healthy good sleepers (N = 22). The SPT-window derived from the algorithm was 10.9 and 2.9 minutes longer compared with sleep diary in men and women, respectively. Mean C-statistic to detect the SPT-window compared to polysomnography was 0.86 and 0.83 in clinic-based and healthy sleepers, respectively. We demonstrated the accuracy of our algorithm to detect the SPT-window. The value of this algorithm lies in studies such as UK Biobank where a sleep diary was not used.},

	abstract = {Rationale: Poor sleep quality is common in the intensive care unit (ICU) and may be associated with adverse outcomes. Hence, ICU-based efforts to promote sleep are gaining attention, motivating interest in methods to measure sleep in critically ill patients. Actigraphy evaluates rest and activity by algorithmically processing gross motor activity data, usually collected by a noninvasive wristwatch-like accelerometer device. In critically ill patients, actigraphy has been used as a surrogate measure of sleep; however, its use has not been systematically reviewed., Objectives: To conduct a systematic review of ICU-based studies that used actigraphy as a surrogate measure of sleep, including its feasibility, validity, and reliability as a measure of sleep in critically ill patients., Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Proquest, and Web of Science for studies that used actigraphy to evaluate sleep in five or more patients in an ICU setting., Results: Our search yielded 4,869 citations, with 13 studies meeting eligibility criteria. These 13 studies were conducted in 10 countries, and eight (62\%) were published since 2008. Across the 13 studies, the mean total sleep time of patients in the ICU, as estimated using actigraphy, ranged from 4.4 to 7.8 hours at nighttime and from 7.1 to 12.1 hours over a 24-hour period, with 1.4 to 49.0 mean nocturnal awakenings and a sleep efficiency of 61 to 75\%. When compared side-by-side with other measures of sleep (polysomnography, nurse assessments, and patient questionnaires), actigraphy consistently yielded higher total sleep time and sleep efficiency, fewer nighttime awakenings (vs. polysomnography), and more overall awakenings (vs. nurse assessment and patient questionnaires). None of the studies evaluated the association between actigraphy-based measures of sleep and outcomes of patients in the ICU., Conclusions: In critically ill patients, actigraphy is being used more frequently as a surrogate measure of sleep; however, because actigraphy only measures gross motor activity, its ability to estimate sleep is limited by the processing algorithm used. Prior ICU-based studies involving actigraphy were heterogeneous and lacked data regarding actigraphy-based measures of sleep and patient outcomes. Larger, more rigorous and standardized studies are needed to better understand the role of actigraphy in evaluating sleep and sleep-related outcomes in critically ill patients.},

OBJECTIVE: To provide recommendations to improve the accuracy of physical activity derived from self report.
PROCESS: We provide an overview of presentations and a compilation of perspectives shared by the authors of this paper and workgroup members.
FINDINGS: We identified a conceptual framework for reducing errors using physical activity self-report questionnaires. The framework identifies 6 steps to reduce error: 1) identifying the need to measure physical activity, 2) selecting an instrument, 3) collecting data, 4) analyzing data, 5) developing a summary score, and 6) interpreting data. Underlying the first 4 steps are behavioral parameters of type, intensity, frequency, and duration of physical activities performed, activity domains, and the location where activities are performed. We identified ways to reduce measurement error at each step and made recommendations for practitioners, researchers, and organizational units to reduce error in questionnaire assessment of physical activity.
CONCLUSIONS: Self-report measures of physical activity have a prominent role in research and practice settings. Measurement error may be reduced by applying the framework discussed in this paper.},

	abstract = {An accelerometer, a wearable motion sensor on the hip or wrist, is becoming a popular tool in clinical and epidemiological studies for measuring the physical activity. Such data provide a series of activity counts at every minute or even more often and displays a person?s activity pattern throughout a day. Unfortunately, the collected data can include irregular missing intervals because of noncompliance of participants and therefore make the statistical analysis more challenging. The purpose of this study is to develop a novel imputation method to handle the multivariate count data, motivated by the accelerometer data structure. We specify the predictive distribution of the missing data with a mixture of zero-inflated Poisson and Log-normal distribution, which is shown to be effective to deal with the minute-by-minute autocorrelation as well as under- and over-dispersion of count data. The imputation is performed at the minute level and follows the principles of multiple imputation using a fully conditional specification with the chained algorithm. To facilitate the practical use of this method, we provide an R package accelmissing. Our method is demonstrated using 2003?2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data.},
