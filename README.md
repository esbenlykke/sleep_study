# Improving Sleep Quality Estimation: A Comparative Study of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques Utilizing Free-Living Accelerometer Data from Thigh-Worn Devices and EEG-Based Sleep Tracking

DOI: []()

Accurately measuring and assessing sleep quality is essential for identifying and addressing sleep-related issues. Recent advances in wearable technology and machine learning offer a promising alternative to traditional PSG-based methods. 

This research project aims to develop machine learning models from accelerometer data from thigh-worn devices using the EEG-based Zmachine device as the gold-standard for detecting in-bed time and time asleep. Thereby, enabling estimation of sleep quality metrics such as sleep efficiency and total sleep time.
