# Sleep Quality Estimation using Accelerometer Data from Thigh-Mounted Devices During Free Living Conditions (working title)

DOI: []()

Accurately measuring and assessing sleep quality is essential for identifying and addressing sleep-related issues. Recent advances in wearable technology and machine learning offer a promising alternative to traditional PSG-based methods. 

This research project aims to develop machine learning models from accelerometer data using the EEG-based Zmachine device as the gold-standard for detecting in-bed time and time asleep. Thereby, enabling estimation of sleep quality metrics such as sleep efficiency and total sleep time.

## Use methods and models

A separate repo with instructions on how to preprocess and derive sleep quality metrics using the models developed in this study will be created soon...
