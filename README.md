# Sleep Quality Estimation using Thigh-Mounted Accelerometer Data in Free Living Conditions (working title)

DOI: []()

Accurately measuring and assessing sleep quality is essential for identifying and addressing sleep-related issues. Recent advances in wearable technology and machine learning offer a promising alternative to traditional PSG-based methods. 

This research project aims to develop machine learning models from accelerometer data using the Zmachine which is an EEG-based device as the gold-standard for detecting in-bed time and time asleep, estimating sleep quality metrics such as sleep efficiency and total sleep time.

By developing accurate machine learning models to estimate sleep quality metrics, this research has the potential to improve our understanding of sleep patterns and inform interventions to improve sleep quality and overall health.
